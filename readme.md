# Welcome to [gilleschatroux]

A web landing page to put my development experiments

## What is Gilles Chatroux ü§î ?

This is just my name and I'm a junior web developper.
This repository is meant to be a place for all kind of testings and projects storage.

## What can you find here üôÑ ?

Not very much for now to be honnest but here are my plans for this repo. I'm creating the index.html on whitch I will link my future projects very soon. The projects section is empty, but I can already tell you what the 3 first projects are going to be about.

- Project 1 : movie search app in Javascript
> Project 1's description
- Project 2 : Todo list app in React
> Project 2's description
- Project 3 : Store takings calculator in Javascript
> Project 3's description

## Profit ü§†

Feel free to explore, and, if you like what you see, to give me some returns about it when I'll let you the possibility to do so via the contact form.
(You can find my email on my profil anyway)

Have a good day folks ! üñê
